# FTCCL
This is an implemention of paper: Federated Temporal-Context Contrastive Learning for Fault Diagnosis using Multiple Datasets with Insufficient Labels

The three datasets in the paper are available at the following links:
CWRU: https://engineering.case.edu/bearingdatacenter/download-data-file
IMS:  https://pan.baidu.com/s/1-IROg_FSVXGX1ERNKj210Q   passwordï¼š8emo
MFD:  https://www02.smt.ufrj.br/~offshore/mfs/page_01.html

The data preprocessing file and the non-iid partition are placed in the datasets folder.

The models folder provides the basic neural network building blocks for training objective functions.

Run the main.py file to train the model and save the results.

The model FTCCL used in the main.py file will be made available after the paper has been accepted.
